## SAE Stuttgart 48 hours Game jam Winner HelpElb goes Mobile

HelpElb is a lowpoly-stylized arcade game about a Panda called "Elb".

Evil deforestation companies are trying to destroy the environment! WWF's famous Panda "Elb" is here to save the day!

While rolling downhill, your goal is to smash as many excavators, cranes and signs as possible! You can even plant trees in the process, by rolling through saplings!

The terrain consists of 7 different pieces that are randomly spawned. So every time you restart the game, the experience will be entirely different!
